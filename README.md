# 📅 Planner

**Google Calendar is for meetings. Planner is for shipping.**

Planner is a specialized project management tool built specifically for content creators who need to balance consistency with variety. It started as a brain dump for video ideas but evolved into a system that forces me to step out of my comfort zone by tracking content types (Tutorials, Live Builds, Thought Leadership).

## 🚀 Features
*   **Visual Strategy:** Drag-and-drop calendar interface designed for high-level channel programming.
*   **Variety Engine:** Color-coded content types ensure I'm not just posting the same tutorial format every week.
*   **Accountability Protocols:** Automatically flags late or missed uploads (the "red zone") to keep the production line moving.
*   **Dreamflow Origin:** Initially prototyped using Dreamflow, demonstrating the power of low-code to pro-code workflows in Flutter.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Framework:** Flutter (Dart)
*   **State Management:** Provider / Riverpod (depending on your build)
*   **Backend:** Integrated with local storage/Firebase (configurable).
